But the Cylons know about it and behind every rock there could be a raider. Since the destruction of the Resurrection ship they changed their tactics from mass to sneak attacks. Several pilots are already dead and especially raider Scar is feared. Meanwhile Starbuck hasn't been herself lately. She drinks a lot, thinks much about Anders and is getting irritated by Kat. She continually challenges her, beats her record in training and calls her the next Tigh. Both claim they will hunt down Scar. 200 cubits and the precious Top Gun trophy, currently in Starbuck's possession, are at stake.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA, UK", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1ODAxNjk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA1NzU0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "1197", "imdbID": "tt0519784", "seriesID": "tt0407362", "Type": "episode", "Response": "True"}
